I want to build a website that takes as input an image and compresses it by half. the website runs a simple image compression algorithm and runs fully on the client side, so it is fast and secure. 

## Project Milestones

### 1. Project Setup and Basic Structure
- [x] Create basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript project structure
- [x] Set up a modern frontend framework (React) for better UI management
- [x] Create a responsive layout with a clean, user-friendly interface
- [x] Add drag-and-drop and file input functionality for image upload

### 2. Image Processing Implementation
- [x] Implement client-side image loading and validation
- [x] Create the image compression algorithm
  - [x] Implement downsampling method
  - [x] Add quality reduction for JPEG compression
  - [x] Implement format conversion if needed
- [x] Add progress indicators during compression
- [x] Implement error handling for various image formats and sizes

### 3. User Interface Development
- [x] Design and implement the main upload interface
- [x] Add preview functionality for original and compressed images
- [x] Display compression statistics (file size before/after)
- [x] Add download functionality for compressed images
- [x] Implement responsive design for mobile devices

### 4. Performance Optimization
- [x] Optimize compression algorithm for better performance
- [ ] Add support for batch processing multiple images
- [x] Implement lazy loading for large images
- [x] Add caching mechanisms for better user experience

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [x] Test with various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- [x] Test with different image sizes
- [x] Perform cross-browser testing
- [x] Test on different devices and screen sizes
- [x] Validate compression quality and file size reduction

### 6. Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Deploy the website to a hosting service
- [ ] Add usage instructions and documentation
- [ ] Implement analytics to track usage
- [ ] Add privacy policy and terms of service
- [ ] Create a feedback mechanism for users

### 7. Additional Features (Optional)
- [ ] Add custom compression level controls
- [ ] Implement image format conversion options
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Include image optimization suggestions
- [ ] Add support for more advanced compression techniques

## Current Progress
- ✅ Basic React project structure has been set up
- ✅ CSS styling has been implemented with responsive design
- ✅ App.jsx component has been implemented with image compression functionality
- ✅ Image upload, compression, and download features are working
- ✅ UI is clean and user-friendly with proper error handling
- Next steps: Consider adding batch processing and custom compression controls
