# Image Compressor Webpage

I'm exploring building a webpage for image compression using Vibecoding. This project aims to create a simple and user-friendly interface for compressing images.

## Project Overview

The webpage will utilize a client-side image compression algorithm, ensuring fast and secure processing. The project is built using React and Vite, with a responsive design for a seamless user experience.

## Current Progress

The project is currently under development, with the following features implemented:

* Image upload and compression
* Preview functionality for original and compressed images
* Compression statistics display
* Download functionality for compressed images

## Future Plans

Future updates will include:

* Adding usage instructions and documentation
